## Balance Checkpoints

Before finalizing an item, verify:

3. **Limitations:** Charges? Per day? Attunement?
4. **Drawbacks:** Curses? Side effects?
5. **Party Impact:** Does it overshadow other characters?

## Attunement Rules

Require attunement when item:
- Provides ongoing combat bonus
- Is Rare or higher
- Has active abilities
- Should be limited to one user

**Maximum attunement slots:** 3 per character

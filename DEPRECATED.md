# ⛔ DEPRECATED: Legacy Vanilla JavaScript Version

## 🚨 WARNING

**All files in the root-level folders are DEPRECATED:**

```
⛔ src/           - Legacy TypeScript source
⛔ components/    - Legacy HTML components  
⛔ css/           - Legacy stylesheets
⛔ index.html     - Legacy entry point
```

---

## ❌ Do NOT Use These Files For:
- ❌ New features
- ❌ Bug fixes  
- ❌ Active development
- ❌ Production deployments

---

## ✅ Use ONLY For:
- ✅ Historical reference
- ✅ Understanding migration decisions
- ✅ Temporary backward compatibility (if needed)

---

## 🎯 Active Development Location

👉 **All active work should be in:** `react-app/`

See [README.md](./README.md) for details.

---

## 📅 Migration Plan

These files will be moved to `legacy-vanilla/` folder in the near future.

If you need functionality from the legacy version:
1. Check if it exists in React version first
2. If not, migrate it properly to React
3. Do NOT copy-paste legacy code directly

---

## 🗑️ Future Action

**Planned:** Move all legacy files to `legacy-vanilla/` to prevent accidental usage.

**Status:** Pending user approval

# ⛔ Legacy Vanilla JavaScript Version

This folder contains the **deprecated** vanilla JavaScript/TypeScript version of the D&D Card Creator.

## 🚨 Status: DEPRECATED

**Do NOT use for active development!**

All new work should be done in the main `react-app/` folder.

---

## 📁 Contents

- `src/` - Legacy TypeScript source code
- `components/` - Legacy HTML components
- `css/` - Legacy stylesheets
- `index.html` - Legacy entry point
- `*.py` - Python utility scripts (icon processing, etc.)
- `*.bat` - Legacy server start scripts

---

## 💡 Purpose

This code is kept for:
- Historical reference
- Understanding migration decisions  
- Extracting functionality to port to React

---

## 🚀 Running (Not Recommended)

If you absolutely need to run the legacy version:

```bash
cd legacy-vanilla
npm install
npm run dev
```

**But seriously, use `react-app/` instead!** 😅

---

See [../README.md](../README.md) for the active React version.
